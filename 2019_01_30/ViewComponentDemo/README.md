# ASP.NET Core ViewComponents
## Presentation Synopsis
This presentation will cover an introduction to View Components, a relatively new feature of ASP.NET Core. They are excellent avenue for creating reusable web components for both Razor Pages and MVC. Unlike their previous counterparts they are designed to be testable and make it easier for the developer to adhere to SOLID principles. I will cover in depth how to create, invoke, consume and test View Components as well as demonstrate different ways of using ViewComponents using a working sample component.

## Bio
Presented by Adam Vincent
I am a Software Engineer at Applied Information Sciences (AIS) and relatively new to the game with 3 years of experience in C# and the .NET stack. I am an advocate for Clean Code, Humane Code and other variants of developing software that is structured not only to meet the requirements of the user, but also software that can be read and maintained because the code clearly communicates the intent of the code.
