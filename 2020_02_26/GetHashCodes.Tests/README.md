# .NET Objects
## Presentation Synopsis
When .NET Core 3.1/.NET Standard 2.0 was released I noticed a new shiny HashCode struct with a Combine() method was added and I wanted to learn a little more about it. So this presentation is about a perspective of what is equality from the ground up.  There’s going to be a couple things out of scope for this presentation because frankly I don’t have enough knowledge to go much deeper in detail. I’m not going to cover Stack vs Heap or how .NET manages memory or anything about garbage collection. I hope to include these things in the future as I explore more things that are indeed relevant.

## Bio
Presented by Adam Vincent
I am a Software Engineer at Applied Information Sciences (AIS) and relatively new to the game with 4 years of experience in C# and the .NET stack. I am an advocate for Clean Code, Humane Code and other variants of developing software that is structured not only to meet the requirements of the user, but also software that can be read and maintained because the code clearly communicates the intent of the code.
